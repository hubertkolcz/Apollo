# Apollo
The Apollo application project allowed the team of students of the University of Gdansk to be ranked third in the international IT competition AIS Student Chapters - Software Innovation Challenge,
which finals took place in Philadelphia in April 2019. The purpose of the creation of the application was to support actions to achieve the goals of the UN's Sustainable Development in the "Zero hunger" and "Responsible production and consumption" categories.

## Technology
The prototype of a hybrid, double-platform (iOS and Android) application which I created by Ionic technology. The prototype was developed to an early stage, meeting the needs of the presentation. To do so, I used Firebase and Google Maps API to simulate a process of purchase selected products.

## Functionalities
Foremost, a user would have an option to select products and add those into a shopping list, based on which back-end logic indicates shops and products with the most favorable prices (due to their expiring time of usefulness). The application would also suggest a recipe for a cheap meal, consists of products from nearby stores.
Secondly, the application would suggest nearby events, which aim to support a local community to achieve the UN's sustainable development goals. Thanks to the integration with Facebook, a user would be able to easily go to an interesting event with his friends.
Both modules would be connected by a gamification system, based on points for contribution to society and monetary gain.
